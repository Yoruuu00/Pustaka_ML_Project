I am happy to fulfillthis request. I hope the readers would appreciate the lean look of thecurrent edition.In one of the previous edition I had realigned the chapters in such amanner that if a C programming course is taught using Let Us C, it can befinished in 22 lectures of one hour each, with one chapter's contentsdevoted to one lecture. I am happy that many readers liked this idea andreported that this has made their learning path trouble-free. A morerational reorganization of end-of-chapter exercises in the book has alsobeen well-received. Riding on that feedback I had introduced one morefeature in the fifteenth edition-KanNotes. These are hand-craftednotes on C programming. From the reader's emails I gather that theyhave turned out to be very useful to help revise their concepts on theday before the examination, viva-voce or interview.Many readers also told me that they have immensely benefitted fromthe inclusion of the chapter on Interview FAQs. I have improved thischapter further. The rationale behind this chapter is simple-ultimatelyall the readers of Let Us C sooner or later end up in an interview roomwhere they are required to take questions on C programming. I nowhave a proof that this chapter has helped to make that journey smoothand fruitful.All the programs present in the book (and some more) are available insource code form at www.kicit.com/books/letusc/sourcecode.
